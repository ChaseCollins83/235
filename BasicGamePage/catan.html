Of course Catan has been regarded as a great gaming experience for a long time now...and that is underlined by the fact that no other game is owned by more players on BGG, with almost 114,000 copies being registered. This is of course only a drop
 in the ocean compared to how many copies have been sold around the world and reside in people's homes.
