                <h1>Chase Collins</h1>
                <p>My name is Chase and I am a 2nd year Game Design and Development Major at RIT. I like playing video games of many genres, but I particularly like shooters and strategy games like Overwatch and Civilization. I play guitar and cello, and I really like playing/listening to blues and blues rock. I'd like to learn more about web in IGME-235 to become a more well-rounded developer in general. By the tiem I graduate, I hope to have a job in tech and to be continuing to improve at making music.
